# Using a sample dataset<a name="sample-data-load"></a>

In this tutorial, you walk through the process to create an Amazon Redshift cluster by using a sample dataset\. Amazon Redshift automatically loads the sample dataset when you are creating a new cluster and connects your new cluster to the query editor\. You can immediately query the data when the cluster is created\.

Before you begin setting up an Amazon Redshift cluster, make sure that you complete the [Sign up for AWS](getting-started.md#rs-gsg-prereq-signup) and [Determine firewall rules](getting-started.md#rs-gsg-prereq-firewall-rules)\.

In this tutorial, you perform the steps shown following:

+ [Step 2: Try example queries using the query editor](rs-gsg-sample-data-load-query.md)

**Important**  
The sample cluster that you create runs in a live environment\. The on\-demand rate is $0\.25 per hour for using the sample cluster that is designed in this tutorial until you delete it\.
