# Using a sample dataset<a name="sample-data-load"></a>

In this tutorial, you walk through the process to create an Amazon Redshift cluster by using a sample dataset\. Amazon Redshift automatically loads the sample dataset when you are creating a new cluster\. You can immediately query the data after the cluster is created\.

Before you begin setting up an Amazon Redshift cluster, make sure that you complete the [Signing up for AWS](console.md#provisioned-prereq-signup) and [Determine firewall rules](console.md#rs-gsg-prereq-firewall-rules)\.

In this tutorial, you perform the steps shown following:

+ [Step 2: Try example queries using the query editors](rs-gsg-sample-data-load-query.md)

**Important**  
The sample cluster that you create runs in a live environment\. The on\-demand rate is $0\.25 per hour for using the sample cluster that is designed in this tutorial until you delete it\.
