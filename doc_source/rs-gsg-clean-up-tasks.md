# Step 6: Reset your environment<a name="rs-gsg-clean-up-tasks"></a>

When you have completed this tutorial, we suggest that you reset your environment to the previous state by deleting your sample cluster\. You continue to incur charges for the Amazon Redshift service until you delete the cluster\.

However, you might want to keep the sample cluster running if you intend to try tasks in other Amazon Redshift guides\. 

**To delete a cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Clusters** to display your list of clusters\. 

1. Choose the **examplecluster** cluster\. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**\. The **Delete cluster** page appears\. 

1. Confirm the cluster to be deleted, then choose **Delete cluster**\. 

On the cluster list page, the cluster status is updated as the cluster is deleted\.
