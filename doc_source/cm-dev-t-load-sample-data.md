# Task 5: Load sample data<a name="cm-dev-t-load-sample-data"></a>

Most of the examples in this guide use the TICKIT sample dataset\. You can download the file [tickitdb\.zip](samples/tickitdb.zip), which contains individual sample data files\.

You can load the sample data to your own Amazon S3 bucket\.

To load the sample data for your database, first create the tables\. Then use the COPY command to load the tables with sample data that is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket\. For steps to create tables and load sample data, see [Step 4: Load data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift](rs-gsg-create-sample-db.md)\.
