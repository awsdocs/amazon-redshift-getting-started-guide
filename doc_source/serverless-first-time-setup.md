# Setting up Amazon Redshift Serverless for the first time<a name="serverless-first-time-setup"></a>

Before you set up Amazon Redshift Serverless console for the first time, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites\. For more information, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/prerequisites.html)\.

The first time you log in to the Amazon Redshift Serverless console, you are prompted to access the [getting started experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-console-getting-started.html), which you can use to configure your Amazon Redshift Serverless instance\. You can use the default settings, or you can customize settings such as credentials, security, and audit logging\. Part of the getting started experience is creating a workgroup and namespace, which are collections of compute resources and database objects, respectively\. For more information about workgroups and namespaces in Amazon Redshift Serverless, see [Overview of Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroups and namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-workgroup-resource.html)\.

When you use Amazon Redshift Serverless, the IAM role you associate to your Amazon Redshift Serverless instance needs a trust relationship with both `redshift.amazonaws.com` and `redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com` to allow Amazon Redshift to assume permissions on your behalf\. For more information, see [ Permissions required to use Amazon Redshift Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-get-started.html#serverless-endpoint-iam-role)\.

After setting up Amazon Redshift Serverless, you can choose to [load sample data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/sample-data-load.html) or to [ use your own dataset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.html)\. Afterwards, you can get started with [common database tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/database-tasks.html)\.
