# Step 1: Create a sample Amazon Redshift cluster<a name="rs-gsg-sample-data-load-create-cluster"></a>

When you have the prerequisites completed, you can start creating your Amazon Redshift cluster, based on a sample dataset\.

**To create an Amazon Redshift cluster based on a sample dataset:**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. To create a cluster, do one of the following:
   + On the Amazon Redshift service page, choose **Create cluster**\. The Create cluster page appears\.
   + On the [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/), choose **DASHBOARD**, then choose **Create cluster**\.
   + On the [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/), choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose **Create cluster**\.

1. In the **Cluster configuration** section, specify a **Cluster identifier**\. This identifier must be unique\. The identifier must be from 1–63 characters using as valid characters a–z \(lowercase only\) and \- \(hyphen\)\. 

   Enter **examplecluster** for this tutorial\.

1. If your organization is eligible and your cluster is being created in an AWS Region where Amazon Redshift Serverless is unavailable, you might be able to create a cluster under the Amazon Redshift free trial program\. Choose either **Production** or **Free trial** to answer the question **What are you planning to use this cluster for?** When you choose **Free trial**, you create a configuration with the dc2\.large node type\. For more information about choosing a free trial, see [Amazon Redshift free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/free-trial/)\.   For a list of AWS Regions where Amazon Redshift Serverless is available, see the endpoints listed for the [Redshift Serverless API ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/redshift-service.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.  

   After you choose your node type, do one of the following:
   + In **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data** to load the sample dataset into your Amazon Redshift cluster\. Amazon Redshift loads the sample dataset Tickit into the default `dev` database and `public` schema\. You can start using the query editor v2 to query data\. 
   + To bring your own data to your Amazon Redshift cluster, choose **Production**\. Then, in **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data**\. For information about bringing your own data, see [Bringing your own data to Amazon Redshift](bring-own-data.md)\.

   Amazon Redshift automatically loads the sample dataset into your sample Amazon Redshift cluster\.

1. In the **Database configuration** section, specify values for **Admin user name** and **Admin user password**\. Or choose **Generate password** to use a password generated by Amazon Redshift\.

   For this tutorial, use these values:
   + **Admin user name**: Enter **awsuser**\.
   + **Admin user password**: Enter a value for the password\.

1. Choose **Create cluster**\. 

This tutorial uses the Amazon Redshift query editor v2\. You can use this editor to query data immediately, after Amazon Redshift finishes creating the cluster\.

You can also choose other SQL client tools that support JDBC or ODBC drivers to work with data in your cluster\. For more information, see [Connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster using SQL client tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-to-cluster.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Management Guide*\.
